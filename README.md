# metagame.unity
[metagame](https://github.com/returnString/metagame) client and example game for the Unity 5 engine.

The client comprises the basic MetagameClient MonoBehaviour and associated types to interact with a running metagame server. The example game makes use of metagame's [sample game data](https://github.com/returnString/metagame/tree/master/sample_game) and the MetagameClient to demonstrate how a Unity game could be structured.

# Demo features
- Authentication - just using the debug platform for now
